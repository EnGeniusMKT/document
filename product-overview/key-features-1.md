# Introduction

The EnGenius EWS Series of wireless management switches is an affordable centralized wired/wireless management system developed specifically for entry-level small-to-medium businesses. This powerful device can be easily deployed and operated by non-tech experts and installed effortlessly and quickly. Any organization with a limited IT team and budget can create a stable and secure wireless network in no time. The system integrates seamlessly with existing routers, switches, firewalls, authentication servers, and other network devices. It can be placed within any network, configured to act as both a wireless controller as well as a Layer 2 gigabit switch, providing robust and centralized management of the whole network through one powerful system. With no additional costs or license purchasing necessary, network administrators can manage and monitor both wired and wireless nodes through a single web interface.

The system can automatically discover any supported EnGenius EWS Series access points connected to the network with a simple click of a mouse, self-configure and become instantly manageable. Simply log into the device via any standard web browser and assign APs into cluster groups. Wireless radio, wireless security, and other wireless related configurations can all be easily applied to multiple APs simultaneously, eliminating the time-consuming process of configuring every wireless access point individually. 

The user-friendly GUI provides instant access to a variety of client and network information including managed AP List, Auto Discovered AP List, Cluster Grouping List, and Client List with complete MAC/IP Address, Incoming/Outgoing Traffic, Wireless Output Power and other relevant information. Traffic statistics of APs and clients are automatically converted into easy-to-understand graphs, providing a visual representation of the network traffic. 

The topology view feature allows administrators to quickly see the whole wired/wireless network topology in real-time for easier planning, troubleshooting, and monitoring. The Floor Plan View and Map View allow for quickly locating deployed APs, a helpful feature for large scale AP deployment and multi-site management. There's also an Intelligent Diagnostics feature for administrators to check the status of wireless APs and provide easy troubleshooting for offline units and rebooting of APs remotely.
