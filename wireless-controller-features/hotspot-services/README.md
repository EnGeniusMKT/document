# Hotspot Services

A hotspot is a wireless network that provides access through a captive portal. Use this feature to set up captive portal-related configurations.

A captive portal can be used to provide authorized guest users with network access while containing unauthorized users. Users will need to enter a valid username and password before they are allowed access to the Internet through the hotspot. Once a captive portal profile is created, the administrator can apply this profile to multiple SSIDs of specific managed APs or AP Group.
