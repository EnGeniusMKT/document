# Mesh Tools

The mesh tools enclose 3 available useful tools including ping, traceroute, and throughput to let users easily verify mesh link effectiveness between participating AP nodes in the mesh network.

**Ping:** This tool can be used to check the reachability from one node to another in a mesh network.
