# Mesh Profile

For WLAN coverage extension for which a wired connection is hard to reach, the EWS controller switch exploits the mesh feature from EnSky AP to extend WLAN connectivity for those areas. A **mesh network** allows managed APs to connect directly to a switch or connect over wireless links dynamically and non-hierarchically to other managed AP nodes and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data.
