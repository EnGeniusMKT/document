## **WLAN Settings - 2.4GHz/5GHz**

Under the WLAN settings, you can create and manage SSID configurations and profiles for the access points to fit your needs. An SSID is basically the name of the wireless network to which a wireless client can connect to. Multiple SSIDs allow administrators to use a single physical network to support multiple applications with different configuration requirements. Up to 8 SSIDs are available per radio. Click on the SSID you wish to make changes to, and you'll be directed to the SSID configuration page.

## **SSID Config**

| **Items**                                   | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enable SSID** | Select to enable or disable this SSID profile. |
| **SSID** |  Enter the SSID for the current profile. This is the name that is visible to wireless clients on the network. |
| **Hidden SSID** |  Enable this option if you do not want to broadcast this SSID. This can help discourage wireless users from connecting to a particular SSID. |
| **VLAN Isolation** | When enabled, all traffic frames from wireless clients connected to this SSID will be tagged with a corresponded 802.1Q VLAN tag when going out from the AP’s Ethernet port.  |
| **VLAN ID** |  When VLAN Isolation is enabled, enter the VLAN ID for the SSID profile. The range is from 1~4094. When VLAN tagging is configured per SSID, all data traffic from wireless users associated with that SSID is tagged with the configured VLAN ID. Please be advised multiple SSIDs also can be configured to use the same VLAN tag; for example, a single VLAN ID could be used to identify all wireless traffic traversing the network, regardless of the SSID. When AP receives VLAN-tagged traffics from the upstream switch or router, it forwards the traffics to the corresponding SSID. |
| **L2 Isolation** | When enabled, wireless client traffic from all hosts and clients on the same subnet will be blocked. |
| **Add Whitelist** |  When L2 Isolation is enabled, users can still enter a specific MAC address per line to be exempt from L2 isolation like a specific file server on the same subnet. |
| **Band Steering** |  When enabled, upon the wireless client first connecting to the SSID, the AP will detect whether or not the wireless client is dual-band capable, and, if it is, it will facilitate the client to connect to the less congested 5GHz SSID to relieve WLAN congestion and overcrowding on the mainstream 2.4GHz frequency. Please be advised it does this by actively discouraging the client's attempts to associate with the 2.4GHz SSID.   |

{% hint style="info" %}
\*\*\*\*👨🏫 **Note: For Band Steering to take effect, both 2.4GHz and 5GHz SSIDs must have the same SSID and security settings. Wireless clients must be in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless coverage zone upon being authenticated with the AP for the Band Steering algorithm to take effect. Several Band Steering options are listed below:**

* **Prefer 5GHz**: All dual-band clients with 5GHz RSSI above the threshold will be connected to the 5GHz band.

* **Force 5GHz**: All dual-band clients will be connected to the 5GHz.
* Band Balance: This option automatically balances the number of newly connected clients across both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands based on configured percentage for 5GHz clients.

_\*\*\*\*_👩🏫 **IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

Band Steering only defines the action when a wireless client associates with an AP for the first time, and the wireless client must be in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless coverage zone when being authenticated with the AP for the Band Steering algorithm to take effect.

**Captive Portal:** When enabled, users will see a captive portal page upon connecting to SSID. The captive portal profile can be customized by clicking “Profile Setting” which can also be configured in Hotspot Service from controller settings.

* **Download Limit:** This specifies the allowed maximum download speed.
* **Upload Limit:** This specifies the allowed maximum upload speed.

**Fast Roaming:** This feature uses protocols defined in 802.11r to facilitate continuous connectivity for wireless devices roaming from one AP to another. Coupled with 802.11k, wireless devices are able to quickly identify nearby APs that are available for roaming and, once the signal strength of the current AP weakens and your device needs to roam to a new AP, it will already know which AP is best to connect with.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*\*\*\*👨🏫 Note that not every wireless client supports 802.11k and 802.11r. Both the SSID and security options must be the same for this fast roaming to work. Fast roaming is available when either WPA2-Enterprise or WPA2-PSK security methods are configured.

## **Advanced Settings**

**LED Control:** In some environments, the blinking LEDs on APs are not welcomed. This option allows you to enable or disable the device’s LED indicators. Note that only indoor models support this feature.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9iPUP4Lj5GjpLCI1Jenp3HL9wIDD9WYf1FLVaNMG8zL9XSpxkbU21qZyS3-DURMFsAuFQ3C62h0UziOGakLyne-n3ZaWjLw1JcqDlzybOI7KjJHoooYc7VYSAXEWzIvcmaxQTXo)

**RSSI Threshold:** With this feature enabled, in order to minimize the time the wireless client spends on passively scanning for a new AP to connect to, the AP will send a disassociation request to the wireless client upon detecting the wireless client's RSSI value lower than the specified. The RSSI value can be adjusted to allow for more clients to stay connected to this access point. Note that setting the RSSI threshold value too low may cause sticky wireless clients to reconnect frequently. Disabling this feature is recommended unless you deem it necessary.
