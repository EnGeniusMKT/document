# Visualization

From here, users can see a visual view of the topology of all supported devices in the network. The EWS switch automatically maps your network deployment and displays the device relationships across your network infrastructureâ€”an essential feature for troubleshooting network issues that would otherwise require manual mapping, monitoring software, or manually keeping track of MAC address tables.

Use the directional pad and the plus or minus buttons to navigate your topology view of the network. You can also search access points in the network via their IP or MAC address. Check the Show Port Info box to display connected port information.
