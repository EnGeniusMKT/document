# Bulk Upgrade

The Bulk Upgrade feature allows administrators to upgrade the firmware of multiple access points at the same time. After uploading the firmware of an AP, the system will automatically display a list of eligible managed access points for this uploaded firmware.

**To upgrade, please follow the steps below:**

1. Click on Upload New File to mount AP firmware onto EWS switch flash.
2. Once the access point firmware is uploaded onto the Controller, the list of eligible access points for this uploaded firmware will appear in the device list.
3. Select the access points you wish to upgrade and click Add to upgrade to start the firmware upgrading process.

**NOTE: Upgrading APs will temporarily disconnect them \(and any associated clients\) from the network. To minimize network disruption, we recommend performing the firmware upgrading procedure at an off-peak time.**
