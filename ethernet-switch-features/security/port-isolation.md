# Port Isolation

Port Isolation feature provides L2 isolation between ports within the same broadcast domain. When enabled, Isolated ports can forward traffic to **Not Isolated ports,** but not to other **Isolated ports. Not Isolated ports** can send traffic to any port whether **Isolated or Not Isolated**. The default setting is Not Isolated.
