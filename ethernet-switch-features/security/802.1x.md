# 802.1x

When a supplicant is connected to a switch port, the port issues an 802.1X authentication request to the attached the 802.1X supplicant. The supplicant replies with the given username and password, and an authentication request is then passed to a configured RADIUS server. The authentication server's user database supports Extended Authentication Protocol \(EAP\), which allows particular guest VLAN memberships to be defined based on each individual user. After authorization, the port connected to the authenticated supplicant then becomes a member of the specified guest VLAN. When the supplicant is successfully authenticated, traffic is automatically assigned to the guest VLAN. The EAP authentication methods supported by the switch are EAP-MD5, EAPTLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-PEAP.

## **Port Settings**

The IEEE 802.1X port-based authentication provides a security standard for network access control with RADIUS servers and holds a network port disconnected until authentication is completed. With 802.1X port-based authentication, the supplicant provides the required credentials, such as username, password, or digital certificate to the authenticator, and the authenticator forwards the credentials to the authentication server for verification to the guest VLAN. If the authentication server determines the credentials are valid, the supplicant is allowed to access resources located on the protected side of the network.

From here, you can configure the port settings as they relate to 802.1X. First, select the mode you wish to utilize from the drop-down box. Next, choose whether to enable or disable re-authentication for the port. Enter the time span that you wish to elapse for the re-authentication Period, Quiet Period, and Supplicant Period. After this, enter the max number of times you wish for the switch to retransmit the EAP request. Finally, choose whether you wish to enable or disable the VLAN ID.
