# 802.1Q

Each VLAN in a network has an associated VLAN ID, which appears in the IEEE 802.1Q tag in the Layer 2 header of packets transmitted on a VLAN. The IEEE 802.1Q specification establishes a standard method for tagging Ethernet frames with VLAN membership information. The key for IEEE 802.1Q to perform its functions is in its tags. 802.1Q-compliant switch ports can be configured to transmit tagged or untagged frames. A tag field containing VLAN information can be inserted into an Ethernet frame. When using 802.1Q VLAN configuration, you configure ports to be a part of a VLAN group. When a port receives data tagged for a VLAN group, the data is discarded unless the port is a member of the VLAN group.

| Enabled | Enables 802.1Q VLANs. This feature is enabled by default. |
| VID | Displays the VLAN ID for which the network policy is defined. The range of the VLAN ID is from 1 to 4094. |
| Name | Enter the VLAN name. You can use up to 32 alphanumeric characters. |
| Tagged Port | Frames transmitted from this port are tagged with the VLAN ID. |

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:  
The switch's default setting is to assign all ports to a single 802.1Q VLAN\(VID 1\).  
Please keep this in mind when configuring the VLAN settings for the switch.**
