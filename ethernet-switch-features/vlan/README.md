# VLAN

A virtual LAN \(VLAN\) is a group of ports that form a logical Ethernet segment on a Layer 2 switch which provides better administration, security, and management of multicast traffic. A VLAN is a network topology configured according to a logical scheme rather than a physical layout. When you use a VLAN, users can be grouped by logical function instead of physical location. All ports that frequently communicate with each other are assigned to the same VLAN, regardless of where they are physically on the network. VLANs let you logically segment your network into different broadcast domains so that you can group ports with related functions into their own separate, logical LAN segments on the same switch. This allows broadcast packets to be forwarded only between ports within the VLAN which can avoid broadcast packets being sent to all the ports on a single switch. A VLAN also increases network performance by limiting broadcasts to a smaller and more manageable logical broadcast domain. VLANs also improve security by limiting traffic to specific broadcast domains.
