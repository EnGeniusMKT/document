# Dual Image

The switch maintains two versions of the switch image in its permanent storage. One image is the active image, and the second image is the backup image. The Dual Image screen enables the user to select which partition will be set as active after the next reset. The switch boots and runs from the active image. If the active image is corrupt, the system automatically boots from the non-active image.
