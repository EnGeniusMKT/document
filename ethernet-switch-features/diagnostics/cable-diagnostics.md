# Cable Diagnostics

Cable Diagnostics helps you detect whether your cable has connectivity problems and provides information about where errors have occurred in the cable. The tests use Time Domain Reflectometry \(TDR\) technology to test the quality of a copper cable attached to a port. TDR detects a cable fault by sending a signal through the cable and reading the signal that is reflected back. All or part of the signal is reflected back either by cable defects or by the end of the cable when an issue is present. Cables are tested when the ports are in the down state, with the exception of the cable length test.

To verify accuracy of the test, it is recommended that you run multiple tests in case of test fault or user error.
