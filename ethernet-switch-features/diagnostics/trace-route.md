# Trace Route

The trace route feature is used to discover the routes that packets take when traveling to their destination. It will list all the routers it passes through until it reaches its destination or fails to reach the destination and is discarded. In testing, it will tell you how long each hop from router to router takes via the trip time of the packets it sends and receives from each successive host in the route.
