# Ping Test

The Packet Internet Groper \(Ping\) Test allows you to verify connectivity to remote hosts. The ping test operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol \(ICMP\) request packets to the tested host and waits for an ICMP response. In the process it measures the time from transmission to reception and records any packet loss. Send a ping request to a specified IPv4 address. Check whether the switch can communicate with a particular network host before testing.

You can vary the test parameters by entering the data in the appropriate boxes. To verify accuracy of the test, it is recommended that you run multiple tests in case of a test fault or user error.

Cable Diagnostics helps you detect whether your cable has connectivity problems and provides information about where errors have occurred in the cable. The tests use Time Domain Reflectometry \(TDR\) technology to test the quality of a copper cable attached to a port. TDR detects a cable fault by sending a signal through the cable and reading the signal that is reflected back. All or part of the signal is reflected back either by cable defects or by the end of the cable when an issue is present. Cables are tested when the ports are in the down state, with the exception of the cable length test.
