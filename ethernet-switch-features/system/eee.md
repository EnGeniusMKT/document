# EEE

Energy Efficient Ethernet \(EEE\), an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\) 802.3az standard, reduces the power consumption of physical layer devices during periods of low link utilization. EEE saves energy by allowing PHY non-essential circuits to shut down when there is no traffic.

Network administrators have long focused on the energy efficiency of their infrastructure, and the EnGenius Layer 2 switch complies with the IEEEâ€™s Energy-Efficient Ethernet \(EEE\) standard. The EEE compliant switch offers users the ability to utilize power that Ethernet links use only during data transmission. Lower Power Idle \(LPI\) is the method for achieving the power saving during Ethernet ideal time.

Use the **EEE** configuration page to configure Energy Efficient Ethernet.
